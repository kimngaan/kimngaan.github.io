This project done by :
-Thi Huynh
-Laurent Vanhee

For the website to work properly:
-The "config.php" file containing the username/password used by phpmyadmin needs to be update if these fields are not already set to the default values.
-Import the file "ecommerce.sql" file with phpmyadmin. NOTE : It will try to create a table called "ecommerce". If one already exists, remove that database otherwise it will fail.

At the start, There will be no accounts registered with the website. 
Enjoy!
